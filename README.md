# Identify The Issue
1. Download the data
2. Clean the data
3. Perform the ETL process to normalize the data
4. Using the dataset provided find the fewest variables out of the dataset that will be required to predict readmission
5. Show what variables they are and why they are important:
      Correlation
      Linear regression
      Logistic regression
      ANOVA
      Multilevel linear modes
      Clusters
      Etcâ€¦

# Show The Issue
1. Using Tableau visualize the data that was provided for this assignment. Keeping in mind the intended audience of nurses and hospital executives present an overall view of the diabetes data set. 

2. Include demographics such as gender and age as well as the features that carry the greatest influence on readmissions.The intention is for each group to walk the audience through the visualization of the data in Tableau so that the audience understands the make up of the patients in the data set as well as the various features that were discovered in the other two projects that have the most influence on readmissions.

3. Make this visualization in Tableau an interactive dashboard so that the end user will be able to drill down as they see fit.

# Create A Solution
Design an infrastructure to support the building and testing of a diabetic readmission predictor model and then the infrastructure to place the model into the clinical workflow
